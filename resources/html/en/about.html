    <h1>About me</h1>

    <p>
        This is a personal website, so I have to say something about me. 
        Well, <strong>I like to create things</strong>: I write, I draw, and 
        I program when necessary.
        I have other hobbiesâ€”I consume a lot of audiovisual content and 
        literature, both fiction and non-fiction, I play video games when 
        something interesting comes out, and I play tabletop RPGs solo or in 
        group. Another thing I like a lot is language learning, but this 
        is a hobby that demands a lot of time that I don't have.

        I really like the idea of <strong>Free Culture</strong>, that's 
        why I publish many of works under permissive licenses. I am not 
        saying I will never release a work under the traditional 
        copyright, but in general I want people to be free to 
        download my materials with no cost, and I want them to be able to 
        create 
        derivative works without major restrictions.

        Do you want something more personal? Okey, here goes, I am Brazilian and 
        I work as a bank clerk. There isn't much else I feel the need to share, I 
        created this website to publish my projects for the community, not 
        to talk about myself, still I might share more details about my 
        life over the years, for now, though, that's it. I hope you enjoy 
        my work.
