        Welcome to the website of Henrique Matheus da Silva Lima

        I make all my projects available here â€” which may include RPG materials, books, software,   
        among others; I also create resources with permissive licenses so that others can
        use them in their own projects.

    <p>
        About publication frequency: I can't promise a periodicity. I have many 
        daily tasks that unfortunately take much of my time, but I will always be engaged 
        in producing something publishable.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you'd like to contact me or keep track of the progress in the 
        development of my projects, you can follow me on 
        <a href="https://x.com/hmslima_" target="_blank">X</a>.

        Sometimes I publish some thoughts, nothing serious, just chitchat level 
        texts. You can see them 
        <span tabindex="0" role="link" class="link"
        onclick="changeElementContent('en', 'text', 'content')">here</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
        This website is also available in Brazilian Portuguese. You can access that 
        version by clicking 
        <span tabindex="0" role="link" class="link" 
        onclick="changeWebsitesLanguage('ptbr', 'home', 'content');"
        onkeydown="if(event.key === 'Enter' || event.key === ' ') {changeWebsitesLanguage('ptbr', 'home', 'content');}">here</span>.
