<h2>Choosing an operating system</h2>

<p class="firstParagraph">
    In May 2025 I was getting frustrated with Linux for the 1,000th time, 
    but I already knew that if I format my computer and install Windows 
    in it, 
    I probably wouldn't last 20 days with Windows, I would end up 
    reinstalling the very same 
    Linux distribution I was using before with the very same settings. 
    I was getting tired of this‚Ä¶
</p>

<p>
    So there was this long weekend in May 2025 that I went to my 
    parent's house where I had a laptop with Windows 11 installed. I 
    seized the opportunity to see whether Windows was good enough to 
    either give it a 
    1,001st chance or to remember why I always come back to Linux 
    every time. 
    Ironically, I wrote good part of this text in my laptop with 
    Windows. <strong>As you can see, I wrote this text not for 
    other person, but for myself! üòÖ</strong>
</p>

<p>
    With what sort of things I feel frustrated with an operating 
    system <em>(no matter whether it is Linux or Windows)</em>? Mostly, 
    a whole set of <span class="smallCaps">small things</span> that make 
    me like or dislike something.
</p>

<p>
    I am not going to talk what OS <em>(operating system)</em> is 
    better for everyone, each person uses the system they want. I will 
    talk here why I personally <sup><em>(intended pleonasm)</em></sup> 
    prefer one or another.
</p>

<p>
    I use Linux for more than 10 years, my first Linux distro was 
    Kurumin 7 <em>(a Brazilian Linux distribution)</em> that I installed 
    in my computer at the second half of the 2000s. That was an amazing 
    experience, it was beautiful, it came with so many pieces of software 
    installed, 
    I've never seen that before. I usually installed Windows XP that came 
    with very few pieces of software, while Kurumin had even an office 
    suite already 
    installed by default!
</p>

<p>
    I am not going to detail my journey with Linux, I will just say that 
    for a good period of time I had a laptop with problematic hardware 
    that didn't work well with Linux, more precisely because of its chipset (SiS‚Ä¶) 
    and the Wi&#8209;Fi; but Mandriva and Mageia <em>(two Linux distributions)</em> 
    had some support for my hardware <em>(not good, but made the computer 
    minimally usable)</em>, but I was 
    constantly using a dual&#8209;boot of Windows XP and Mandriva/Mageia. Because of 
    this problematic hardware, I also couldn't use Windows 7, being stuck with 
    Windows XP and a small selection of Linux distros that came with 
    the too specific drivers. The situation changed when I bought a 
    Samsung laptop in 2018, finally I could use Linux with all of the potential 
    of my hardware, but I constantly installed Windows 10/11, and then few days later 
    I came back to Linux in which I used for months until I installed Windows 
    again, repeating the cycle.
</p>

<p>
    Let me first talk the points in which Linux is problematic, and 
    therefore Windows is better:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        This is not Linux's fault, but the user of the 
        open source OS is a second 
        class citizen when it comes to software availability. 
        Even if there 
        is a version for Linux, it may be of inferior quality, an example 
        is the WhatsApp app for Desktop. To be honest, 
        this is not a serious problem, the Linux versions are good enough 
        <em>(if it's not of the same quality, I admit that I am being a bit 
        dramatic here)</em>, 
        and there are a lot of open source software that are of great quality, 
        like LibreOffice, Krita, SMPlayer, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
        For some reason this is a polemic topic, but‚Ä¶ <em>(perhaps my life 
        will be at risk after I say this)</em> ‚Ä¶Linux is less stable 
        than Windows. Don't misunderstand me, it's not that bad, and I hadn't 
        problems for the last 10 years with fixed release distros, but I've 
        <span class="smallCaps">never</span> 
        had a problem of system breaking with Windows. Once I tested OpenSUSE 
        Tumbleweed <em>(a rolling release distro famous for being stable)</em>, 
        and in less than 15 days my system broke; and no, I didn't 
        mess with the repositories or modified anything sensible; the system, 
        in a beautiful day, didn't boot, so I had to install other OS in my 
        laptop, wasting a time I didn't have. With Windows, I don't have such 
        problems, 
        I shut down my computer and I do know that it will boot normally when I 
        turn it on the next day, unless the computer has a serious hardware issue, 
        but this would not the fault of the OS. I only use fixed released distros 
        now, maybe I change my mind when immutable Linux distros got actually 
        mature.
    </li>
    <li>
        The office suite's UI <em>(User Interface)</em>. Most of my projects are 
        made in an office suite, more precisely in a text processor. As a Linux user, 
        LibreOffice is the default office suite, and it has no actual competitors 
        if you ignore the issue of the support for the <em>proprietary</em> file 
        formats of 
        Microsoft Office. LibreOffice is 
        available for 
        both Windows and Linux, and since I love the idea of free formats, even 
        if I use Windows I 
        end up being ‚Äúforced‚Äù to use LibreOffice because of the free format. 
        <em>However, I can save ODT files with newer versions of Microsoft Office 
        (although we know the ODF file will not be as good as if it were generated 
        by LibreOffice, actually far from it‚Ä¶)</em>, and there is 
        also the strict Open XML DOCX format‚Ä¶ ü§î.
        <br>
        I am sorry, I still didn't 
        say my point: well, LibreOffice's UI is too outdated for my tastes, I liked 
        it in the past, but I want something‚Ä¶ more beautiful. When I compare Microsoft 
        Office's UI with LibreOffice's UI, the difference is brutal, Microsoft 
        Office's UI is so beautiful that it's a pleasure only in using it. Yes, I know 
        that LibreOffice has alternative UIs, but they are criminally ugly to my eyes 
        that and prefer to still use the default outdated UI.
        <br>
        I know that there are other office suites for Linux with good UI, but 
        they don't have a minimally decent grammar check for Brazilian Portuguese, 
        so they are not actual options for me. And no, software like LaTeX, SILE, and 
        Typst are not options for me.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Until now, I only badmouthed Linux, let's start talking about its good features:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        It's free and open source. I love the Open Source and Free Software 
        philosophy, that why my projects usually have the free Creative Commons 
        license.
    </li>
    <li>It's more secure. No virus, no privacy issues.</li>
    <li>
        For now <em>(remember, it was 2025 when I wrote this text, and Windows 11 was 
        the current version)</em>, I can use Windows offline, but for how long? It's 
        ridiculous to require that an operating system must be online all 
        the time. You who is reading this text may not have other things to do with your 
        computer when there is no internet, but I do üòâ, so actually is a good thing 
        for me 
        when there is no connection to the web, in this way I have less distractions, 
        and I can work in some projects.
    </li>
    <li>
        Linux boost my productivity for a series of reasons. Remember that I cited 
        <span class="smallCaps">small things</span>? Let's talk about them:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Tabs in their file manager. Yes, I know, Windows Explorer since 
                Windows 11 has tabs, but their Linux counterparts have this feature for 
                more than 10 years, and give better experience.
            </li>
            <li>
                The desktop environment KDE Plasma and its programs. KDE is the eighth 
                wonder of the world, it has everything I need, it's complete of 
                functionalities, it's beautiful enough. It seems that the KDE team made 
                an DE <em>(Desktop Environment)</em> specifically for me. And its 
                programs are amazing:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Dolphin: The KDE's file manager. It can remember the individual 
                        visualization settings of each folder like Windows Explorer does 
                        <em>(for some reason, this functionality doesn't exist in other 
                        DEs file managers except Cinnamon's one)</em>, and it's a 
                        beautiful program that is able to show the thumbnails of a great 
                        variety of files, like EPUB.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Okular: the perfect <s>PDF</s> document viewer, it has great 
                        functionalities, and can also read comic book files <em>(for CBR 
                        files, there are some issues if it's not a traditional installation 
                        in Linux‚Ä¶)</em>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        KolourPaint: I don't know you, but I am always using a Paint-like 
                        program to make very basic editions. KolourPaint is the only program 
                        that I am comfortable in using, and it's better than Windows' Paint.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Linux provides some key shortcuts for entering certain characters when I am 
                using a simple text editor, two characters that 
                I use a lot are the quotation marks ‚Äú‚Äù.<br>
                In Linux: AltGr v for ‚Äú and AltGr b for ‚Äù<br>
                In Windows: Alt 0 1 4 7 for ‚Äú and Alt 0 1 4 8 for ‚Äù<br>
                There are other shortcuts too, but I don't want to take too long with this 
                topic, the point is that Linux's shortcuts are shorter.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        While Linux only gets better, Windows gets worse. I am not saying Windows gets worse 
        in terms of quality of software or UI, but in how it treats its users with privacy 
        issues, and other absurd requirements. At least Windows 11 is usable for me, but if 
        certain lines are crossed, I will definitively forget Windows and stick with Linux <em>(or 
        any new operating system that may appear in the future)</em>; macOS is not an option for 
        me because the price 
        of a MacBook is terribly prohibitive in Brazil.

    Honestly, at the end of the day, my biggest problem is with the office suite's UI.  
    You may think that this is a small problem, but after the browser, the thing that I 
    use the most in a computer is the office suite, more precisely the word processor. 
    So, what kind of frustration I wanna have, a word processor with annoyingly 
    outdated UI <em>(that I will continue using a lot on Windows anyway)</em>, or go 
    with Windows and all of its problems?
</p>

<p>
    No, there is not going to have any plot twist here, I will continue with Linux. 
    At the end of that long weekend in May 2025, I even bought a USB stick and put 
    Windows 11 in it, but soon I realized that Windows is not the answer for me.
