<h2>My homebrew rules for Basic Fantasy</h2>

<p>
    <a href="https://www.basicfantasy.org/" target="_blank">Basic Fantasy</a> is my TTRPG 
    system of choice, especially because it is <em>an open source project with an active 
    community</em>. This system has the advantage of not being too crunchy like many famous 
    systems we see out there, but since it is a retroclone, it keeps some design choices 
    I particularly don't love.
</p>

<p>
    I basically only play Basic Fantasy in <strong>sole mode</strong>, so most of my 
    homebrew rules aim 
    to simplify the system in order to make the game easier to manage. Here are the 
    changes I made:
</p>

<h3>Powerful characters</h3>

<p>
    When playing solo, I may play with only one character. In this case, I 
    multiply the recommended level by the recommended number of characters of the party. 
    For example, if an adventure requires a party of three level one members, I create 
    a level three character. 
</p>

<h3>Skill checks</h3>

<p>
    All skill checks are based on the roll of 2d6 plus the modifier bonus/penalty, 
    the modifier is chosen based on the type of the task. If the character must open 
    a stuck door, the modifier will be strength bonus/penalty; if the character tries to 
    convince someone, the modifier will be charisma bonus/penalty. The context will 
    matter, if the character that must open the stuck door is hurt or hungry, the level 
    of difficulty will be hard, or if he is a close friend of the person he is trying to 
    convince, the level of difficulty will be easy; here are the target numbers:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Very easy:</b> 3+</li>
    <li><b>Easy:</b> 5+</li>
    <li><b>Standard:</b> 7+</li>
    <li><b>Challenging:</b> 9+</li>
    <li><b>Hard:</b> 11+</li>
</ul>

<p>
    These skill checks include detection of secret doors, any ability of thieves, etc.
</p>

<h3>Equipment</h3>

<p>
    All the equipment <em>(what includes money)</em> is shared, so I don't need to worry 
    what items belong to each one of my PCs, it's much easier to manage the party in this 
    way.
</p>

<h3>Saving Throws</h3>

<p>
    Forget Death Ray, Dragon Breath, Paralysis, etc. All saves are resumed to one single 
    number that is calculated by the simple formula 
    15&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;(HD&nbsp;&divide;&nbsp;2), in which the result of division of HD 
    by 2 is rounded up. For example, an orc of HD 1 has the Saving Throw of value 
    14.
