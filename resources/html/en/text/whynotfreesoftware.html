<h2>Why I use Microsoft Office and Windows</h2>

<p>
    This text may sound strange to many people because the 
    vast majority of the world 
    uses Windows and Microsoft Office, but 
    you may have noticed that I love free culture, so it's fair 
    to assume that I like <strong>free software</strong> too. 
    The assumption 
    is correct; I love and support free software. I started using 
    Linux and OpenOffice (later LibreOffice) since 2008, and I used 
    them for over a decade. So, why the editable files of some 
    projects of mine are in the DOCX format?
</p>

<p>
    Linux has the advantage of being lightweight and secure, it also offers a 
    lot of options, it's undeniably better for privacy in comparison to 
    other operating systems, and it has the eighth wonder of the world: KDE 
    Plasma and its apps that I use even in Windows, like Okular.
</p>

<p>
    In regard to LibreOffice, more precisely to the ODT format, 
    I don't know how the format works in 
    technical point of view, but it feels more organized when I 
    edit an ODT file 
    in LibreOffice when I compare to the edition of a DOCX file in Microsoft 
    Office.

<p>
    So, if I have all of these praises for Linux and LibreOffice, why 
    don't I use them exclusively? Let's start with Linux.
</p>

<p>
    As I said, I used Linux for over a decade; I know the system very well 
    as a user. The problem is that Linux is unstable for me. And no, 
    I didn't use rolling release distributions in which I installed strange 
    third-party packages that messed up the system; and I didn't have Windows 
    in another partition. The last straw was when my installation of a 
    Debian-based distro simply stopped working on its own; it was 
    giving small signals of failure, and when I tried to restart the 
    system in a certain day, it didn't reboot anymore. It seems that I was having a 
    hardware issue, but I installed Windows 11, and I had no more problems 
    in the very same hardware.
</p>

<p>
    LibreOffice was another reason that motivated me to abandon Linux. In the 
    beginning I liked its “Windows 2003 UI”, but I started growing tired 
    of this outdated appearance; even the alternative UI notebookbar was so 
    unpleasant to my eyes that I preferred to stay with the standard UI. 
    <em>Keep in mind that I wrote this text in July 2025, that was the 
    reality of the time</em>. Another problem was the formatting bugs; 
    sections with double columns had frequent problems with tables that 
    got their lines separated among different pages — no matter that I 
    configured the table to not be separated between pages. There was 
    also a sensible
    problem in the exported PDF files, it was that colored 
    lines with columns that frequently presented no-colored parts where the 
    lines of some columns and lines were present, what was very annoying. 
    I know that WYSIWYG text processors are always problematic, but 
    I had fewer issues with Microsoft Office than with LibreOffice. You may 
    ask me why I didn't try other text processors available for Linux, but 
    none of them are as good as LibreOffice.

    But I keep using LibreOffice with the ODT format whenever I can. 
    Like it or not, this is cost-free software available for all relevant 
    desktop operating systems. I only use Microsoft Office and its 
    file format DOCX when the document will have a bit more complex 
    formatting.
